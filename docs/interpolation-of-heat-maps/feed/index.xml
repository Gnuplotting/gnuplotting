					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know if it by design or something funny happens when 2d projection is done, but you feed 6x6 matrix and what is plotted in Figure 1 is a 5x5 matrix (even when not interpolated) -- I actually need all col and rows -- any idea how to fix it? I tried pretty much every combination of plot/splot paramters, but it is not working ( I have ugly workaround by setting xrange to a range slightly longer+taller and offsetting from set xrange [0:5] to set xrange[-0.5, 5.5]. Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I tried to plot this txt file (http://1drv.ms/1P22zYh). while it does plot it correctly with the command stated in the above article, the plot is upside down. while i could invert the diagram, but then the axis would invert as well. what could possibly be the reason for this?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for a great tutorial! I was frantically looking for a way to make something like a Mathematica density plot in Gnuplot, and this is the only place I could find such a thing. Three cheers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Jorge.

If your data is in the &lt;a href=&quot;./../../manpage-gnuplot-4-6/index.html#Q1-1-742&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;right format&lt;/a&gt; it is straightforward. Just remove the &lt;code&gt;matrix&lt;/code&gt; option and plot it with
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
splot &#039;heat_map_data.txt&#039;
&lt;/pre&gt;
The rest of the code should be the same.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Be very carefull with the use of pm3d for matrix representation !!!!
As it&#039;s written in GNUPLOT manual, with the plot command and a M x N matrix, you will have a surface of M x N elements. This is different from the pm3d plotting style, where an M x N set of data will form a surface of (M-1) x (N-1) elements.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m pretty sure it is bilinear. As you can see such changes clearly along the main axis in Fig. 3 (horizontal and vertical) indicating the plains were interpolating with two constant directional vector x and y for each plain. (From the given point, the interpolated data is radially symmetric along both axis).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I believe it is bicubic.  I ran into an issue with overshoot from interpolation with pm3d plots.  This indicates that it&#039;s not linear.  Can someone verify or refute this?]]></description>
