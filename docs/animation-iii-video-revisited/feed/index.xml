					<description><![CDATA[Your code has the answer also to my last question. The code is so intensive that it does not manage to create any video file because it still creating the images. I would like to change this approach by just directing the latest image to screen but keeping in memory the previous pictures such that the user can browse images in some interface. How can you reach such a model? I think qt can be a good option as a terminal.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Everything works now! The output is in the working directory as image stream (113 images for me). Have you found a solution which produces directly a video file from these pictures directly? Even better would be - a direct output to the screen as video.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I did &quot;brew uninstall gnuplot; brew install gnuplot --with-cairo&quot;. I run &quot;animate_ir.gnu&quot; but the code seems to be in some infinite loop. I have the data ir.txt in the same working directory as the code. How much time did it took from you to run this code? I am running OSX Yosemite for this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Can I ask a stupid question? I have the following problem.. I have a csv file with 2 columns with x (time) and y values of a trajectory.. I need to animate the trajectory as it evolves over time.. So in each frame i I suppose I have to plot all values until i and some marker in the end to denote the current position.. How can I adapt your code to do that? I cannot get it to work..

Thanks a lot,]]></description>
