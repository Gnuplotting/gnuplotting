					<description><![CDATA[Gnuplot 5.0 defaults to a colorblind-friendly set of colors.  I have normal color vision, but find the second and third colors (dark green and light blue) a bit hard to distinguish.  However, setting &quot;lw 2&quot; helps.  

Unfortunately the png terminal still doesn&#039;t support dashed lines, and with OS X, the pngcairo terminal is not available (at least with the homebrew version of gnuplot).  I need to import the images into Microsoft Word, so I&#039;m currently using the emf terminal.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you very much hagen!

sorry for the delay ---one year is nothing (?). By that time I was writting my master thesis and I was so busy and exhausted that I didn&#039;t remember to come back again to the site and see your answer.

Today I came back because of a different issue to this page and saw it. Should I see your answer a year ago, today that plot on my printed thesis will not have two overlaying grids jaja.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One should also refrain from using red and green colors in plots. It is not nice to the colorblind. Especially in heatmaps and the like. Also it is a good idea to make each plot stile distinct in gamma value and dot type (to make lines distinguishable when converted to greyscale).

Just my two cents.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;./../comment-page-1/index.html#comment-56555&quot;&gt;Alejandro&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Alejandro.

I know this problem and solved it by including a white rectangle in my plot under the zooming part.

I created a new entry for this: ./../../zooming-in-with-multiplot/index.html

Thanks for the nice question.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Hagen! First of all, your labour in this website is inspiring. I wish scientists pay at least a 1/10 of the dedication you pay to plotting.

Second, a question. Suppose you&#039;re using multiplot option, in a way that there is a main plot and a zoom of it. Then suppose that you define a grid on the main plot and another grid in the zoom plot. It occurs that the &quot;main grid&quot; also get into in the zoom plot! For me, the mix of grids in the zoom plot doesn&#039;t look OK. Do you know a way to, for example, define a white background for the zooms and then define the grid?

Thank you very much! Greetings from Buenos Aires]]></description>
