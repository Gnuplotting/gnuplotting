					<description><![CDATA[Hello, I was trying this but ran into problems with installing mencoder on Windows 10. I struggled through all the readmes and help documents, but it seems I am too stupid to get this running. I have the the source and the codecs unpacked in a &quot;mencoder&quot; folder in :C//. What do I have to do that the Program will be found by Windows, so that the given code works?]]></description>
