					<description><![CDATA[Hi, 

Is it possible to change the background colour of a graph such that the interior of the graph (within the axes) is of one colour, and the exterior (outside the axes) is of another colour?

Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice example but I&#039;ve had a hard time to reproduce it. In both version 5.0.4 and 5.0.6 the &quot;border&quot; keyword for the fill style appears to be ignored when the y1=-360 is set. So all you get is white on white. Couldn&#039;t find a fix for but it works in 5.0.0 so I just used the older version.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was looking for a way to use the plot for command with decimals. I found this page but I wasn&#039;t able to produce a result with this command

plot for [h=0:1:0.1] sin(x*h)

So I asked in the StackOverflow and a nice gentleman tells me that the increment of the for loop in gnuplot is &quot;cast&quot; to integer. So in your example, the increment is actually -2. 

If you want to check the question here is the link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33244494/gnuplot-for-loop-with-increment-smaller-then-1

Also in the gnuplot manual, page 98, it is written the following:

&quot;The iteration variable (’i’ in this example) is treated as an integer, and may be used more than once.&quot;

Hope this helps!]]></description>
