					<description><![CDATA[This is clearly  awesome but what about the overlapping data? Is there a way without fillings and without column line so that it looks something like steps? I know you can do it  in PGPLOTS but  that  is very  basic to follow. Something like: https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/cgi/figs/cgi0606.gif]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,
I have a data file consisting of single column having 1000 rows. I would like to plot normalized histogram and then would like to extract the middle point of each bar (x,y values of each) of the histogram. Next would like to fit with a user defined function those data. Would you please provide me the gnuplot script if possible?
Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Many thanks for your tutorial!!
However, could you please explain the meaning of these numbers?

&quot;a = 30.
mu = 3.
sigma = 3.&quot;

and &quot;every ::0::7 u 1:2&quot;

Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for providing this script. It is very helpful.
I encountered a little problem when trying to plot a phase distribution in the range of -pi to pi. Easy copy &#038; past will only work under the condition, that the number of bins has to be integer by the chosen binwidth. Otherwise you get artifacts (actual a bin to much at the right hand side).

I wrote a short improvement for such a chase:

#target binwidth
maxbinwidth = 0.25
#start point
binstart = -pi
#endpoint (rightmost edge of last bin)
binstopp = pi
#calculate number of bins (integer)
nobins = ceil( (binstopp-binstart)/maxbinwidth )
#actual binwidth

print &#039;&#039;
print &#039;!!! ALERT !!!&#039;
print nobins, &#039; bins with a width of &#039;, binwidth, &#039; are used. This is a difference of &#039;, binwidth-maxbinwidth, &#039; of target width.
print &#039;&#039;

then load hist-function.]]></description>
