					<description><![CDATA[Sorry for a new comment. When creating successive electrons, positrons, or so on, the last of the circles is &#039;overwritten&#039; by the next object. This is difficult to notice if the &#039;max&#039; variable is high enough as in the examples, but if it is low enough you can see the loose of one circle per object. To avoid this, the ending of &#039;electron.gnu&#039; and &#039;positron.gnu&#039; could be rewritten as: 

  # Set new object and label number
  object_number = object_number+max
  label_number = label_number+1

In addition, with this change, if you need to clear all this objects but not others, you can write:
  gnuplot&#062; unset for [n=object_number-1:1:-1] object n
  gnuplot&#062; unset for [n=label_number-1:1:-1] label n
  gnuplot&#062; object_number=1; label_number=1

And replot conveniently. Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you very much for this article, it has been very useful for me. Nevertheless, using Gnuplot 4.6 over AquaTerm, the border of the circles appeared, so that I had to add the &#039;noborder&#039; modifier which specifies that no bounding lines are drawn:

set for [n=0:max-1] object n+object_number circle \
    at posx(x,n,max/1.0),posy(y,n,max/1.0) size size(n,max/1.0)
set for [n=0:max-1] object n+object_number \
    fc rgb star(n,max/1.0) fillstyle solid noborder lw 0]]></description>
