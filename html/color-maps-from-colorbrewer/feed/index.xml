					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for your answer.
I was thinking maybe something using pm3d and additional column for color code?
Anyway, if you  come up with a solution, please share it with us!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Tetiana.

This is indeed a feature that is missing, and I&#039;m afraid it is not straight forward to achieve as gnuplot normally cannot know beforehand how many lines you will plot.
Maybe there is a way to write a function or a script that gets as input the number of lines and the color palette to use and generates the corresponding line styles on the fly. I will think about it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First of all, thank you very much for this amazing web-site. I&#039;ve learned so many amazing new things!

I have a question about using palettes for line colours. Number of lines in my plots is varying (from a few to a few tens), but I want them to be rainbow-coloured, with the first line always being red, and the last line always being purple. By defining line styles, I am able to achieve the desired result only for as many lines as there are styles. Could you help me with this?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Jasmine.

I&#039;m afraid you have to specify your problem a little bit more precise:
* what do you mean by &quot;colorful vectors&quot;? Using the &lt;a href=&quot;./../../manpage-gnuplot-4-6/index.html#Q1-1-177&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;vector plotting style&lt;/a&gt; with different colors?
* are the three categories separated by the columns or have you three categories in all of the columns?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the nice illustration. I have a question regarding to plotting several colorful vectors. 
My dataset consists of 4 columns in which I have three categories . 
All categories should be plotted as vector but in different colors. 
Could you advise me how I could do that in gnuplot?

Thanks]]></description>
